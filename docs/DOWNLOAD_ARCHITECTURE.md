# Download and storage architecture

## Storage boundaries

`cinerusubs-media` is private and contains full video files, HLS manifests/segments, and subtitle files. `cinerusubs-assets` contains posters, backdrops, avatars, and other presentation assets. Every `MediaAsset` stores its bucket and object key; every `MediaVersion` binds its direct file to the media bucket. Public API responses omit object keys, bucket credentials, mirror target URLs, and presigned R2 URLs.

Object keys are generated on the server from a sanitized basename and random UUID:

```text
media/movies/<content-id>/<uuid>/<safe-file-name>
media/episodes/<content-id>/<uuid>/<safe-file-name>
subtitles/movies/<content-id>/<uuid>-<safe-file-name>
posters/movies/<content-id>/<uuid>-<safe-file-name>
```

The uploader uses single-part presigned `PUT` for small files and 100 MiB multipart parts for files over 500 MiB. The admin interface reports percent, speed, ETA, and current part; it can pause between parts, resume, retry a failed part three times, or abort the multipart upload. Completion checks R2 metadata before creating the asset record.

## Direct-download sequence

1. A title page receives safe media-version and mirror metadata only.
2. The user opens the quality-grouped download modal and selects the CineruSubs source.
3. The branded `/download/<media-version-id>` page shows an honest three-second preparation state.
4. `/api/download/<media-version-id>` rate-limits the requester, reloads title/version rights and state, checks the active asset, and creates a 90-second opaque AES-256-GCM payload with an HMAC-SHA-256 signature.
5. `/api/download/file/<token>` verifies and decrypts the token, repeats live authorization and object-scope checks, increments counters, and records the event.
6. With `DOWNLOAD_WORKER_ENABLED=false`, the gateway redirects to a short-lived R2 attachment URL. With the Worker enabled, it redirects to `dl.cinerusubs.com/v1/files/<token>`; the Worker verifies signature, expiry, media-bucket scope, and object key, then streams the R2 object with `GET`, `HEAD`, byte-range, `206`, `Content-Range`, and `Accept-Ranges` support.

Tokens carry no credentials. They expire quickly, are scoped to one bucket/key/version, and are sent only through no-store pages and responses. Rotating `DOWNLOAD_SIGNING_SECRET` invalidates outstanding tokens.

## Mirrors and health

Mirror target URLs remain server-side. Public responses expose provider metadata and an application redirect path. That redirect reloads version/title state, checks distribution rights, rate-limits, records the provider download, and then redirects. Admins may add, prioritize, disable, and health-check HTTPS mirrors. URL validation rejects embedded credentials, localhost, loopback, link-local, and private IPv4 targets. A production egress policy should also block private/reserved ranges after DNS resolution to prevent DNS-rebinding SSRF.

## HLS playback

When `streamingManifestKey` is present, the watch service prefers HLS and the client uses native HLS or `hls.js`. The player exposes automatic/manual quality, multiple audio tracks, subtitles, volume, speed, picture-in-picture, fullscreen, progress sync, and keyboard controls (Space, left/right arrows, M, F). A direct MP4/WebM file remains an authorized fallback.

For production HLS, manifests and every referenced segment must be delivered through an authorization-aware media gateway or contain separately authorized URLs. Signing only a private master-manifest object does not authorize relative R2 segment requests.

## Deletion lifecycle

Disabling a version removes it from public selection without deleting bytes. Deletion marks the version/asset `pending_deletion`; cleanup should run only after retention and reference checks. The storage dashboard shows both buckets, object counts/bytes by kind, growth windows, largest files, recent uploads, database records missing objects, and unreferenced objects. Never bulk-delete audit findings without manual review and a recoverable backup.
